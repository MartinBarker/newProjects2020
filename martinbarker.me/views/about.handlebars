                    In 2019 I graduated from OSU with a BS in Applied Computer Science (Cybersecurity), and am
                    currently living in
                    Seattle,
                    WA. I am also a
                    <a href="https://mixcloud.com/martinradio/">DJ</a> who uploads rare records <a
                        href="http://www.martinradio.com">online</a>, and creates music-related
                    software <a href="http://martinbarker.me/projects">projects</a> that benefit the
                    online music community.

                        My applied CS degree gave me the unique perspective of software development
                        from a
                        cybersecurity view. My courses included programming in languages such as
                        Python, C++, C, as
                        well as bash and linux command line experience. I also took courses on web
                        devlopment using
                        NodeJS, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Django. As well as database setup /
                        management with SQL
                        and PostgreSQL. My cybersecurity courses taught me computer networking
                        protocols and
                        security, as well as threat detection / response. </span>

                        Working at Zume before the Seattle office was laid off, I was able to get hands on experience
                        with the full Devops pipeline of code deployment from a local environment to the production
                        clusters. I created Kubernetes clusters from scratch in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and
                        installed Helm as well as ingress load balancers. I also wrote my own Helm charts and
                        Dockerfiles, as well as created webhooks to trigger the Docker image build process in Jenkins.
                        This process of installing services to different cluster environments (dev / perf / staging /
                        prod) was automated by Spinnaker pipelines that I also wrote. I carried a security mindset
                        throughout all my work, setting up alert monitoring and handling cluster authorization.

                        MoxiWorks is an expanding real estate tech startup located in Pioneer
                        Square. As a QA
                        engineer I write automated testing software in Java to cover the Moxi suite
                        of web products
                        as well as their external API. Our workflow uses agile development and

                        new features, as well as git to maintain the shared repo we all work in.
                        This position has
                        helped strengthen my programming habits for writing scalable code meant to
                        be reused /
                        revisited by different people for years to come. It's also given me more

                        communicating with a team through daily standup meetings. </span>

                    <span class="hidden-phone">
                        At Orange Media Network I worked as student engineer for OSU's TV / Radio
                        station KBVR FM /
                        TV. I was in charge of learning and teaching state-of-the-art media software
                        / hardware used
                        in our daily TV productions and radio broadcasts. I ran audio for
                        on-location OSU football
                        broadcasts, and was sent to the National Association of Broadcasters
                        convention in Las Vegas
                        by my college in 2015 / 2016. The position helped me gain experience in
                        learning new tech
                        outside my comfort zone, and teaching that technology to students in an
                        understandable way
                        devoid of technical jargon.</span>
